BlueNMEA for Android
====================

 http://max.kellermann.name/projects/blue-nmea/

BlueNMEA is an Android application which sends location data over
Bluetooth (RFCOMM) in the NMEA format.

I wrote this program to feed my PDA running XCSoar
(http://www.xcsoar.org/).


Compiling the sources
---------------------

You need:

- Android SDK 1.5
- Android NDK 1.5
- Apache Ant and a Java SDK
- GNU make

Add the Android SDK to your PATH.  Run:

 make NDK_ROOT=/path/to/android-ndk

This builds bin/.BlueNMEA-debug.apk


Using BlueNMEA
--------------

Right now, BlueNMEA can not listen for incoming RFCOMM connections.
It attempts to initiate the connection.

Make the remote device listen for RFCOMM.  On Windows Mobile, create
an incoming COM port, and make the Bluetooth adapter visible.

In BlueNMEA, select the GPS source, and click on "connect".  It
attempts to discover nearby Bluetooth devices (no pairing required
currently).  Click on the desired remote device.

Once connected and location information is available, BlueNMEA starts
sending NMEA records.
