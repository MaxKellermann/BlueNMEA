BlueNMEA for Android
====================

 http://max.kellermann.name/projects/blue-nmea/

BlueNMEA is an Android application which sends location data over
Bluetooth (RFCOMM) in the NMEA format.

I wrote this program to feed my PDA running XCSoar
(http://www.xcsoar.org/).


Compiling the sources
---------------------

You need:

- Android SDK 1.5
- Android NDK r4b
- Apache Ant and a Java SDK
- GNU make
- libbluetooth compiled for Android

Add the Android SDK to your PATH.  Run:

 make SDK_ROOT=/path/to/android-sdk NDK_ROOT=/path/to/android-ndk LIBBLUETOOTH_BASE=/path/to/libbluetooth

This builds bin/.BlueNMEA-debug.apk


Compiling libbluetooth
----------------------

libbluetooth was part of the 1.5 NDK, but was removed in later
versions.  This means that we need to compile our own version of that
library - which is tricky, because Android uses a non-standard build
system.

The BlueNMEA git repository contains a build script for libbluetooth
in the according branch.  Run "ndk-build", then copy the headers
(./lib/*.h) to $LIBBLUETOOTH_BASE/include/bluetooth and
./obj/local/armeabi/libbluetooth.a to $LIBBLUETOOTH_BASE/libs/armeabi.


Using BlueNMEA over Bluetooth
-----------------------------

Right now, BlueNMEA can not listen for incoming RFCOMM connections.
It attempts to initiate the connection.

Make the remote device listen for RFCOMM.  On Windows Mobile, create
an incoming COM port, and make the Bluetooth adapter visible.

In BlueNMEA, select the GPS source, and click on "connect".  It
attempts to discover nearby Bluetooth devices (no pairing required
currently).  Click on the desired remote device.

Once connected and location information is available, BlueNMEA starts
sending NMEA records.


Using BlueNMEA over USB
-----------------------

Needs the Android SDK.

Connect your phone to a computer with the USB data cable.  On the
computer, type "adb forward tcp:4352 tcp:4352".  Now you can get NMEA
data by connecting to TCP 4352 on your computer.
